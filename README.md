# hello-world
Hi! My name is Lindsey! I am a recent college graduate with a bachelor degree in General Studies. In June I will be attending grad school to obtain a master degree in computer system technology with a concentration in computer science. 
I have experience in the healthcare industry, so I would really enjoy working on software development that helps our healthcare providers.
